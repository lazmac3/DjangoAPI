# DjangoAPI
This was a coursework I made for my Masters. It is an API for a social media app in Django.
The API could be called to add users as long as they had a valid oAuth 2 token.
The API could be called to add status that other users could like. The database could be called by a basic front end to view the status, sort by topic and see who like each post.
